## 🔮 What is Precogly?

Precogly is an open platform designed to fill the gap between manual diagramming tools and closed-source commercial platforms.

We are building a tool that supports:
* **Threat Modeling as Code:** Version controlled, diff-able, and integrated into CI/CD.
* **Enterprise Scale:** Collaboration features, SSO readiness, and compliance mapping.
* **Open Standards:** No vendor lock-in. Your models belong to you.

## 📅 The Roadmap

* **Jan 15, 2026:** Project Announcement & Partner Program ([precogly.org](https://precogly.org))
* **Feb 12, 2026:** **Public Alpha Release (v0.1)** - The code in this repository will be unlocked.

## 🤝 Join the Launch

We are building a network of **Enterprise Success Partners** and open-source contributors.

* **Practitioners:** Star this repo to watch the release.
* **Partners:** [Contact us](https://precogly.org) to discuss the founding partner program.

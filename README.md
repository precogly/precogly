## 🔮 What is Precogly?

Precogly is an open platform designed to fill the gap between manual diagramming tools and closed-source commercial platforms.

We are building a tool that supports:
* **DFD Editing:** Threat modeling via an interactive UI, using reusable libraries and workflows.
* **Enterprise Scale:** Collaboration features, SSO readiness, and compliance mapping.
* **Open Standards:** No vendor lock-in. Your models belong to you.

## 📅 The Roadmap

* **Jan 15, 2026:** Project Announcement & Partner Program
* **Feb 12, 2026:** **Public Alpha Release (v0.1)** - The code in this repository will be unlocked.
